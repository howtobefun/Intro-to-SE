Your shoulders should be relaxed.\r\n\r\nEngage Your Core:\r\n\r\nTighten your abdominal muscles to maintain stability and support your lower back throughout the exercise.\r\n\r\nShrug Your Shoulders:\r\n\r\nLift your shoulders straight up towards your ears as high as you can. Imagine trying to touch your shoulders to your ears. Avoid rolling your shoulders backward or forward; the movement should be straight up and down.\r\nKeep your arms straight, allowing the dumbbells to rise naturally as your shoulders lift.\r\n\r\nPause:\r\n\r\nBriefly pause at the top of the movement, squeezing your trapezius muscles.\r\n\r\nLower Your Shoulders:\r\n\r\nSlowly lower your shoulders back to the starting position in a controlled manner.",

With a slight bend in your elbow, raise your arm across your body and out to the side until it is level with the ground. Your palm should face downward or slightly backward at the top of the movement.

Let your arm hang down in front of your body, palm facing toward your thigh.\r\n\r\nStarting Position:\r\n\r\nMaintain a straight back and engage your core for stability. Your shoulders should be relaxed, and your chest should be up.\r\n\r\nExecuting the Raise:\r\n\r\nKeeping your arm straight, slowly lift the dumbbell directly in front of you until it is at shoulder height. Focus on using your shoulder muscles to lift the weight, rather than swinging the arm. Keep your wrist in a neutral position, neither flexing nor extending.\r\n\r\nEnd Position:\r\n\r\nAt the top of the movement, your arm should be parallel to the floor, and the dumbbell should be at shoulder height. Pause briefly to feel the contraction in your anterior deltoid.\r\n\r\nReturn to Starting Position:\r\n\r\nLower the dumbbell back down in a controlled manner, returning to the starting position with your arm hanging straight down. Avoid letting the weight drop; maintain control throughout the descent.",

Adjust the decline bench to a suitable angle (typically 15-30 degrees).\r\n\r\nPositioning Yourself:\r\n\r\nLie down on the decline bench with your feet securely hooked under the foot pads to prevent sliding. Position yourself so that your eyes are directly under the barbell.\r\n\r\nHand Placement:\r\n\r\nGrip the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your palms should face forward, and your thumbs should wrap around the bar.\r\n\r\nUnracking the Barbell:\r\n\r\nWith the help of a spotter if available, unrack the barbell by straightening your arms and moving the barbell over your lower chest. Your arms should be perpendicular to the floor.\r\n\r\nLowering the Barbell:\r\n\r\nInhale deeply and lower the barbell slowly and under control to your lower chest. Your elbows should be at about a 45-degree angle to your body. Lower the bar until it lightly touches your lower chest. Do not bounce the bar off your chest.\r\n\r\nPressing the Barbell:\r\n\r\nExhale and press the barbell back up to the starting position by fully extending your arms. Focus on squeezing your chest muscles during the lift. Keep your wrists straight and your elbows slightly tucked in to protect your shoulder joints.",
